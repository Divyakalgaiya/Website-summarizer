# Website-summarizer
Developed an interactive web app using BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Gradio for the user interface.
The Web Summarizer App is designed to extract and condense the content of any publicly accessible website into a short, meaningful summary. This is achieved by integrating web scraping techniques with natural language processing (NLP).

üîç Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
Web scraping involves programmatically extracting information from websites. The app uses BeautifulSoup, a Python library, to parse HTML content from a given URL. It identifies relevant text elements such as headings, paragraphs, and article sections, and filters out unnecessary elements like advertisements, navigation bars, or scripts.

üß† Natural Language Summarization
Once the raw text is extracted, it is cleaned and processed for summarization. The summarization process can use:

Extractive summarization, which selects the most important sentences directly from the text.

Abstractive summarization (optional, using transformer models), which rewrites the content in a concise form using AI.

For simplicity and performance, extractive methods (like sentence ranking based on frequency or scoring) are often preferred in initial implementations.

üñºÔ∏è Gradio Frontend
The app features a user-friendly interface built with Gradio, allowing users to input a URL and view the generated summary instantly. This removes the need for coding knowledge and makes the tool accessible to everyone.
