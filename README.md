# Website-summarizer
Developed an interactive web app using BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Gradio for the user interface.
The Web Summarizer App is a powerful tool designed to extract the main content from any website and generate a concise summary using a LLaMA language model. It combines web scraping, text preprocessing, and large language model-based summarization, all integrated into a user-friendly Gradio interface.

üîç 1. Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
Web scraping is the initial step where the app fetches content from a user-provided URL. Using BeautifulSoup, a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, the app locates relevant content like article text, headings, and paragraphs, while ignoring irrelevant elements like ads or navigation menus.

üß† 2. Text Summarization with LLaMA
After extracting the content, the cleaned text is passed to a LLaMA-based language model (e.g., LLaMA 2), which performs abstractive summarization. Unlike extractive methods that simply pull sentences from the original content, LLaMA generates new, concise summaries that capture the essence of the information.

Why LLaMA?

Trained on a vast corpus of internet data, making it capable of understanding and rewriting content effectively.

Lightweight enough to be used locally or via API, depending on deployment.

More fluent and coherent output compared to traditional rule-based methods.

üñºÔ∏è 3. User Interface with Gradio
The app uses Gradio to create a simple, interactive web interface. Users only need to enter a URL, and the app returns a summarized version of the page within seconds‚Äîno technical background required.

üß© Core Workflow
Input: URL of a webpage

Process:

Scrape content using BeautifulSoup

Clean and preprocess the text

Summarize the content using a LLaMA model

Output: Human-like summary generated by LLaMA

‚úÖ Advantages
